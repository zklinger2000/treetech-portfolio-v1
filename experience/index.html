        <h1>A little history</h1>
        <p>
          My first "real" job was at an internet startup testing web 
          sites, clicking buttons and banner ads.  Later, I worked as a black box 
          tester for video games.  Believing I had more to offer, I became an
          instructor at a small art college teaching animation.
          Within a year, teaching students taught me one thing: I'd rather be 
          working on projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few years of hard work, I had my name in the credits of 
          <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2699540/">movies, games and cartoons</a>
          doing everything from animating superheroes to compositing spaceships over
          green screens.

          Sounds great, but, I always regretted not learning to write code.  No 
          matter what I was doing, I kept coming to the realization that I could be 
          "doing this better".  I often knew exactly what I wanted done, in a sort of
          primal, pseudocode way, but could never stop working long enough to sit 
          down and learn, really learn, how to write code and build the things I 
          could imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not so long ago I committed myself to take the next step in this saga.  First,
          I went back to school and took all the Computer Science courses my community 
          college offered, all in C++, ending up with a 3.75 GPA.  After that, like so 
          many others, I set off on my own for a while, eventually finding "Web Developer"
          to be the job description I was working towards.  Prepending "Full Stack" to
          that title being the next logical move.
